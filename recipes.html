            <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world.

                <li>Macaroni</li>
                <li>Butter and Flour</li>

            <h4>Recipe Steps</h4>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a 13"x9" baking dish with butter. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook macaroni, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1 stick butter. Sprinkle flour over and cook, stirring, until slightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in milk and whisk until combined. Add mustard powder; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Remove pan from heat and whisk in cheddar, Gruyère, and 1 cup Parmesan until melted and smooth. Stir in macaroni and transfer to the prepared dish.
                </li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine panko, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan. Sprinkle over macaroni; season with more pepper.
                </li>
                <li>​​Bake mac and cheese until bubbly and golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.

            <h3>Category: Main Dish</h3>
            <img src="images/Japanese%20Chicken Curry.jpg" width = "400" alt="Bowl of chicken curry with rice">
            <p>Unlike Indian or Thai curry, Japanese curry is more savory than spicy. It’s an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan.</p> 
            
            <h4>Recipe Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>water</li>
                <li>1 package curry sauce mix</li>
                <li>1 can peas</li>
                <li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
                <li>1 package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Recipe Steps</h4>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.
                </li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>​Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.
                </li>
